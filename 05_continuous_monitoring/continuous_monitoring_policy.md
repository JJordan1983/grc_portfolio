## 1. Purpose
Define cadence and responsibilities for ongoing assessment of security controls, vulnerability scanning, and POA&M maintenance.

## 2. Monitoring Cadence
| Activity | Tool | Frequency | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| External vuln scans | Tenable/ACAS | Monthly | Vulnerability Manager |
| Internal agent health | Defender for Endpoint | Daily | SOC |
| Config drift checks | Intune/Group Policy | Weekly | SysAdmin |
| Log aggregation | Sentinel | Continuous | SOC |
| POA&M review | POA&M Tracker | Monthly | ISSO |
| Control assessment spotâ€‘checks | Manual/Automated | Quarterly | ISSM |

## 3. POA&M Lifecycle
1. Identify weakness â†’ 2. Assign owner/date â†’ 3. Mitigate or accept risk â†’ 4. Validate fix â†’ 5. Close & archive evidence.

### POA&M Tracking (Sample)
| Weakness ID | Control | Description | Owner | Planned Completion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| POAMâ€‘2025â€‘001 | IAâ€‘5 | Breachedâ€‘password screening not enabled | IAM Lead | 2025â€‘11â€‘15 | In Progress | Change ticket #321 |
| POAMâ€‘2025â€‘002 | ACâ€‘17 | MFA missing for VPN breakâ€‘glass acct | Network Lead | 2025â€‘10â€‘30 | Open | VPN config PR #88 |

## 4. Metrics & Reporting
- Top open POA&Ms by age/severity  
- Patch SLA adherence (Critical â‰¤ 15 days, High â‰¤ 30 days)  
- Endpoint coverage (% with EDR)  
- Authentication failures trend & admin activities

## 5. Evidence Retention
- Logs: 12 months minimum (hot + cold storage)  
- Scan results and POA&M exports: 12 months minimum

## 6. Change Management Linkage
Remediation requiring config change follows CMâ€‘3/CMâ€‘4 processes with rollback plan and approvals.
